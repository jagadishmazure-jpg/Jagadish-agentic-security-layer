"""Strict, view-aware authorizer tests (grokbot-portfolio review, 2026-10-18).

The text check is switched off in the gateway tests, so every denial here
comes from the SQLite authorizer alone: a base-table READ is allowed only
when SQLite reports it on behalf of an allowed view (view-name argument);
a READ whose view-name argument is None is denied; sqlite_master and
load_extension are always denied.
